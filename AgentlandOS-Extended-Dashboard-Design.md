# AgentlandOS Extended Dashboard – Living AIaaS Control Center Design Guide

@AgentlandOS-Extended-Dashboard-Design

## Purpose
This guide documents the UI/UX, architecture, and implementation patterns for the AgentlandOS Extended Dashboard – Living AIaaS Control Center. It serves as a reference for future development and onboarding.

---

## 1. UI/UX Structure
- **Navigation:** Fixed top navigation bar with brand, tabs (Dashboard, AI Services, MCP Tools, Analytics, Settings), notifications, and user menu.
- **Event Stream:** AG-UI Event Stream Visualizer (top-right) shows real-time system and tool events with animated status.
- **MCP Tools Orchestra:** Grid of interactive tool cards (left), each with status indicators, tooltips, and activity animations.
- **Business Intelligence Dashboard:** Metrics cards (bottom) with animated values, sparklines, and change indicators.
- **Task Timeline:** 16-week roadmap timeline (right) with progress bars, status, and completion states.
- **Customer Pipeline:** Multi-stage pipeline visualizer (center) with drag-and-drop lead cards and dynamic stage counts.
- **Connector Status:** Fixed integration status panel (bottom-right) for external APIs (DATEV, Lexware, etc).
- **Data Flow Canvas:** Animated background canvas visualizing data/AI activity.
- **Responsive Grid:** Uses CSS grid for adaptive layout, with mobile breakpoints for stacking and resizing.

## 2. Key Components & Patterns
- **Micro-interactions:** Hover, pulse, and slide-in animations for feedback and engagement.
- **Live Data:** Simulated real-time updates for metrics, events, and pipeline using JS intervals.
- **Tooltips:** Contextual tooltips on hover for all interactive elements.
- **Drag & Drop:** Pipeline stages support drag-and-drop for leads, updating counts and visual feedback.
- **Accessibility:** Uses semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and keyboard navigation patterns.
- **Theming:** Centralized CSS variables for color, spacing, and animation speeds.
- **Loading States:** Skeleton loaders and animated progress bars for async data.

## 3. Implementation Patterns
- **Componentization:** Each dashboard area (event stream, tools, BI, timeline, pipeline) is modular and can be mapped to React components.
- **State Management:** Simulated with JS classes; in production, use React state/hooks or a global store.
- **Animation:** CSS keyframes for pulse, slide, and metric loading; requestAnimationFrame for canvas effects.
- **Responsiveness:** Media queries for grid adaptation and mobile usability.
- **Extensibility:** New tools, metrics, or pipeline stages can be added by extending the relevant grid or list.
- **Integration:** Designed for easy connection to backend APIs for live data.

## 4. Reference Implementation
- See `AgentlandOS Extended Dashboard - Living AIaaS Control Center.html` for full HTML, CSS, and JS reference.
- Use this file as a canonical source for layout, style, and interaction details.

---

## 5. Best Practices
- Follow the design tokens and color variables for consistency.
- Maintain accessibility and keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.
- Use modular, reusable components for each dashboard section.
- Animate state changes for user feedback.
- Keep the dashboard performant by limiting DOM updates and optimizing canvas animations.
